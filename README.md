Program "draws" a box given length and width

test:

input width or height less than 2 leads to the programme prompting the user to re-enter the values to be able to draw the box. 

So with input width 2 and height 0 user will see the following message:

"Value entered is not sufficient to build a box. 
Please enter a new value: "
